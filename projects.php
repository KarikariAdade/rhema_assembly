				<p>The purpose of this theme, “I Will Build My Church”, is to help bring to the fore the understanding of the dual identity of the Church; that the church is called out of the world to belong to God and sent back into the world to witness and to serve. If the church is able to rediscover its identity as originally given by God in the Scriptures, and made alive and relevant by the Spirit of God, we could be in the most exciting times in the history of the church. Everything depends on our ability to understand the Church as it ought to be, our willingness to change where necessary and above all, our determination to keep our lives continually opened to spiritual freshness. The energy then derived could help us do more for the Kingdom of God. This is because the transformation of the society cannot take place without the transformation of the church. Society will listen to the testimony of a credible church, a church living out the values and principles of Christ. <a href="baptism">Read More Here</a>
