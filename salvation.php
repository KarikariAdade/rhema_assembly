		<h1>Christianity</h1>
		<div>
		<p><span>God, through the sacrifice of His Son, offers salvation and life to anyone who believes in Him. Salvation is a gift of grace not by works.</span> Christians are people who believe that the blood of Jesus Christ, shed on the cross, provides the sole basis for the forgiveness of sin. Therefore, salvation occurs only when a person places their faith in the death and resurrection of Christ as the sufficient payment for their sin. Believing in Christ for salvation involves:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><span>FAITH</span> For by grace I am saved through faith.</p></li>
			<li><p><span>TRUST</span> Letting go of my self-directed life to Christ's life.</p></li>
			<li><p><span>REPENTANCE</span> Changing my mind and life direction.</p></li>
			<li><p><span>LORDSHIP</span> Confessing Christ as my savior and lord.</p></li>

		<h1>Do You Know Jesus?</h1>
		<p id="know_jesus_intro">If you're not 100% sure you know Him as your Lord and Savior, God has provided a simple way for you to change that. Romans 10:13 tells us that "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved". It's really that simple to accept Jesus' free gift of salvation.</p>

			<h3>Sample Prayer</h3>
			<p>Jesus, I know that I am a sinner and do not deserve this life you've given me. I believe You died and rose from the grave to make a place for me in Heaven. Forgive me for my sins and save me from the life I have known. Come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. AMEN.<br><br>
